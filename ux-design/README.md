UX Design
=================

## Purpose:

The purpose of this exercise is to get a greater understanding of your design process.

### Instructions:

Describe a unique UX problem you've worked on recently, and provide a few paragraphs that explain your process for arriving at a solution. (Don't spend more than one hour on this!)

#### Submission

Create a folder and write your answer into a markdown or text file. You may include any sketches, screenshots, or other artifacts you think would be helpful in documenting and explaining your process in this folder as well.

When you are done, create a zip file containing all your work, [create a candidate account on our recruiting site](https://people.adhoc.team/candidates/sign_up) and upload your solution.
